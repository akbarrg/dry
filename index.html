<h2>Continuous Integration (CI)</h2>
<p>This is the practice of regularly merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared codebase. Automated tools check the code to ensure it works, runs tests, and catches errors early. It’s like having a safety net that ensures everyone’s work fits together seamlessly.</p>

<h2>Continuous Deployment (CD)</h2>
<p>This takes it one step further by automating the actual deployment of the code to production. After passing all tests, the code is released to users without any manual steps. It’s like having a self-driving car for software delivery, where updates happen automatically.</p>
